This is my observation

# Packet Loss

Text communication doesn't have the facial actions, 90% of communication is missing. 
A lot of time is spent trying to guess what certain punctuation means.

Verbal communication on phone, still cant get body language,

Traditional communication.

This is like packet loss where the message is not sent and received properly. Partial message, partial results.

# Technology is supposed to be fast.

But sometimes it slows us down.
Accessibility and design issues make it impossible to adopt.

We are trading humanity for efficiency.
relationships are transactional, everything is quantifiable and measurable, those that aren't we strive to make measurable.

# Loneliness pandemic.

Mental health issues caused by loneliness
Life expectancy decreases.

We are replacing a live experience with a wire mother.
Evidence of the problem is in robot companionship, because it's cheaper and easier to outsource caring for others to a machine.
If you put fur on a machine, then it is the same as a human.

Suicide rates increasing in teens, especially girls, who are able to compare themselves much more easily.
A globalized world where everything is in one place means that there are more losers and less winners, but the fewer winners take more.
There are many ways of phrasing the same thing.

Disinformation erodes trust in authorities.
Every second person is an expert in anything, especially if you are imaginative.

Culture is eroded down into basics, attention and desire become the currencies by which we judge value.

# Mobile phones

Immersion means we sit at a table looking at phones rather than talking to each other. Long term implications are lack of learning social skills, inability to communicate, and lack of human contact.

# Pessimism towards technology

People use technology but I feel like there's a growing pessimism and dislike of technology.
Social media is notorious, people hate Facebook, for its disrespect of privacy, and because being 'facebook friends' is meaningless.
